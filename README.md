# 🕹 Memorable Video Games: An Introduction
Video games, as a creative medium, have had a tremendous influence on me over the decades. As a means to celebrate, I want to take a look back at some of the most memorable titles of the past twenty-some years.

Each individual collage features twelve prominent games within a year, followed by a short description. These are games that are either critically acclaimed, highly popular, or, in some cases, hidden gems waiting to be explored and cherished. Many of them, you will find, have cemented themselves as some of the greatest titles ever made. For some readers, this will be a fun trip down memory lane, and for others, a chance to discover something new and exciting.

**Note:** As a visual person and someone who appreciates image quality, probably the biggest challenge in putting this together was finding high-quality cover art, especially for older titles. Some even had to be recreated. However, I believe the things that challenge you the most also teach you the most.

It’s the year 2024, and we *still* don’t have flying cars or, I don’t know, teleportation! Dang it. Well, at least, we got some great games, right? . . . *Right*? [staring intensifies]

The most recent of this line-up, *Black Myth: Wukong*, is a smashing success right out of the gate, and it’s looking like a solid Game of the Year contender. In other Soulslike news, *Elden Ring* players are eating good this year, with *Shadow of the Erdtree*—FromSoftware’s largest expansion to date—feeling almost like a new game.

*Helldivers II*, which is only available on PC and PlayStation, very quickly made a name for itself in the co-op multiplayer landscape. On Steam alone, it’s still getting 25,000 concurrent players on average seven months post-release. *Sea of Thieves* finally coming to PlayStation 5 also made a big splash after being exclusive to Xbox platforms since 2018. (Make sure to check out our [guides](https://fragfriend.com/category/sea-of-thieves), written by our resident *Sea of Thieves* expert **FoolishPirate**.) It’d be great if *Helldivers II* came out on Xbox so that the rest of the gaming community could join in on the fun, but that is yet to be seen.

And while it’s been a terrific year for indies, *Animal Well* and *Balatro* are some of the clear standouts and definitely worth checking out. The latter is a FragFriend favorite. It’s a simple enough game on the surface, with a very satisfying gameplay loop, but it’s not so easy to master. If you’re struggling or just starting out, make sure to read our [guides](https://fragfriend.com/category/balatro).

# 2023
<p align="center">

</p>

If there were a Hall of Fame for video game years, 2023 would undoubtedly be in it. This is one of the best years we’ve had in a while, with banger after banger after banger. In my opinion, the only year that surpasses it, in terms of the sheer number of high-quality releases, is 2007. Looking at the line-up, Larian’s *Baldur’s Gate 3* was met with an overwhelming amount of success, broke into the mainstream, and swept pretty much all the major awards, and deservedly so; Capcom, unsurprisingly, knocked it out of the park with yet another excellent remake, this time, *Resident Evil 4*; *Phantom Liberty* finally marked the redemption arc for *Cyberpunk 2077* three years after its disastrous launch in 2020; and the long-awaited *Alan Wake II* absolutely ruled, pushing the envelope with its stunning visuals and compelling narrative.

Stepping into *The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom* right after spending 100 hours in *Breath of the Wild* just felt right for me. The first game took my breath away, but *Tears of the Kingdom* is in a league of its own. It’s an impressive sequel to an already impressive game—a must-play if you own a Nintendo Switch.

This is the year that the cult classic *Hotline Miami* and its sequel were ported to the ninth-gen consoles, which brings me to an important, yet underrated title. [*Otxo*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1608640/OTXO) (pronounced oh-cho) is a *Hotline Miami*-esque roguelike that takes the original formula and improves on it tremendously. It’s a game that, after putting almost thirty hours into it, I feel I like more than its original inspiration. Unlike its influence, where enemies could kill you with one hit, you now have a health bar, and there’s a bullet time mechanic that completely transforms the gameplay. I recommend giving it a chance.

But that’s not all. It was an outstanding year for video game adaptations as well, above all, HBO’s breakout hit *The Last of Us* and *The Super Mario Bros. Movie*. Whatever happens, I think 2023 will go down in history as one of the best years in gaming.

# 2022
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6604c059-3f1c-44d8-b78d-a159c0311e84" alt="2022"/>
</p>

*Elden Ring*, *God of War Ragnarök*, *The Last of Us Part I*, and *Horizon Forbidden West* all in one year? Not bad. Not bad at all.

*The Stanley Parable* is one of the most creative and hilarious games I’ve ever come across, and *Ultra Deluxe* expands on that original idea in every way. The 2013 release had nineteen different endings, and yes, I had to see them all! *Ultra Deluxe*—wait for it—comes with a whopping forty-two!

Speaking of innovation, *Sifu* and *Stray*, despite being nothing alike, share one common element, and that is their originality. I cannot wait to get my hands on both of them, especially *Stray*, since I *adore* cats. 

# 2021
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ef413a9-aaf2-41a9-93f9-9aef3c6c3ed8" alt="2021"/>
</p>

2021 was kind of hot! It didn’t quite impress, but it did okay.

Of all the above, I only played *Twelve Minutes* in 2021. It’s a fresh take on an old genre, and one that I got a kick out of. Since then, I managed to get into *Forza Horizon 5*, and I have been hooked! It is incredibly entertaining and quite addictive, there’s great variety, and it never stops being fun—a personal ten out of ten. If you’re a driving enthusiast like me, don’t sleep on the *Horizon* series. With Microsoft announcing *Forza Horizon 4* being delisted from digital platforms (Microsoft Store and [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1293830/Forza_Horizon_4)) on December 15, 2024, now would be a great time to add this superb, content-filled arcade racer to your library.

</p>

### *Unpacking*
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d81f981d-6667-4b48-a220-2c302032d147" alt="Unpacking (2021)"/>
</p>

I’d like to give a big shoutout to one of my all-time favorite indies. There’s an irresistible charm to [*Unpacking*](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1135690/Unpacking) that draws you in and captures your heart. It is as delightful as it is unique, as relaxing as it is exciting. And despite not having a single word of dialogue, it manages to tell a subtle yet powerful story of a young girl throughout her life. I was lucky enough to share this game with my new-to-video-games girlfriend, and at the end of each level, we would share screenshots of how we each decorated our home. Suffice it to say, it made for some lovely gaming sessions, and quite a few amusing moments.

# 2020
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63400670/135312941-f1cf5233-9608-49b2-8ecb-ad4a74597c23.jpg" alt="2020"/>
</p>

2020 gave me one of my favorites of all time, *Control Ultimate Edition*, and we celebrated its fifth birthday last week on August 27, 2024. With just the right amount of weird, phenomenal storytelling, and drop-dead gorgeous visuals, *Control* deserves all the praise it gets. It laid the groundwork for the Remedy Connected Universe, confirming that it, along with *Max Payne* and *Alan Wake*, share the same universe. Alan Wake himself appears in the *AWE* expansion, giving fans of the 2010 cult classic plenty to chew on. You can read my impressions of this masterpiece [here](https://graph.org/Remedys-Control-A-Generation-Defining-Masterpiece-02-10).

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d8bcb33-fee9-4fd3-82c2-2e9886cd32ed" alt="Control Ultimate Edition (2020)"/>
</p>

Being primarily a PC gamer, though, I feel like I miss out on so many amazing games—*The Last of Us Part II* or *Ghost of Tsushima* from this year alone. They are right up my alley. I very much need to get my hands on a newer PlayStation console. With PlayStation 5 Pro on the horizon, I’m considering entering console gaming for the first time in a very long time.

I also played *Resident Evil 3*, which I enjoyed. Not as much as *Resident Evil 2*, which was a more focused and tight experience, but Capcom is certainly on the right track with these remakes.

# 2019
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63400670/135319254-74593d94-bbe8-41b8-a7e6-b7bf2cbdd799.jpg" alt="2019"/>
</p>

2019 was the year I got back into gaming after a seven-year break, reuniting with a long-lost passion that felt just as fulfilling as discovering it for the first time. So many greats came out that year, and I have yet to play most of them, but *Resident Evil 2* and *A Plague Tale: Innocence* are ones that stood out for me the most.

# 2018
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63400670/135319618-a96df816-a342-4666-ac73-2f4b3383bff6.jpg" alt="2018"/>
</p>

2018 gave us *Shadow of the Tomb Raider*, *Red Dead Redemption 2* (although I’d play it two years later on PC), *God of War*, and a handful of remarkable indie games.

Looking back, I’ve fallen in love with the *Forza* series, and I have been dying to get a racing wheel.

### *Red Dead Redemption 2*
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63400670/135465912-8a2c03fe-553c-46c0-9b17-bbb8d9ca0248.png" alt="Red Dead Redemption 2 (2018)"/>
</p>

In early 2020, I’d only played a few hours of *Red Dead Redemption 2*. The game felt like a *huge* improvement over its predecessor, but my initial impression wasn’t as enthusiastic as I’d hoped. I was put off by how slow-paced the gameplay was, which, in retrospect, is quite common among first-time players. Coming off of games like *GTA*, I simply couldn’t appreciate what *Red Dead Redemption 2* was offering. I still had it on my computer, and I was waiting for the right moment to jump back in. Believe it or not, it took me fourteen months to pick it back up, and it *blew* my mind! I have since put in 120 hours into this masterpiece, the longest I’ve spent in any single-player game, and I can see myself enjoying it for at least another fifty hours. I highly recommend reading *The New York Times*’s “[*Red Dead Redemption 2* Is True Art](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/23/opinion/sunday/red-dead-redemption-2-fallout-76-video-games.html).”

# 2017
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63400670/135319771-dbb45db2-726d-45b4-82c9-0af7173402d2.jpg" alt="2017"/>
</p>

2017 saw the likes of *The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild* and *Horizon Zero Dawn*.

It was an awesome year for indies as well, offering *Cuphead* and *What Remains of Edith Finch*. *Sonic Mania* gave me such a hard time, probably because I’m not great at fast-paced platformers, but it was worth it in the end. And *Little Nightmares*, even though the controls could be clunky at times, did feel special.

### *The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild*
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff6ffdc2-7fe1-4639-80b8-8a6a7844c3f1" alt="The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (2017)"/>
</p>

*Breath of the Wild* gave me something no other game has. The level of [true freedom and sense of exploration](https://youtu.be/2Sc-4akLN_w?t=317) made me feel like a kid again. It sparked in me a long-forgotten sense of childlike wonder that I hadn’t felt in a very long time, and that I will not soon forget. I didn’t think that was possible. Kudos to everyone at Nintendo.

# 2016
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63400670/135319980-f053dc31-f98b-4fd4-84d7-1f069de04633.jpg" alt="2016"/>
</p>

2016 brought *Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End*, *Titanfall 2*, and *Quantum Break*, which, despite its shortcomings, I genuinely enjoyed.

### *Inside*
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63400670/135466338-4a2f201c-ae20-42c1-8696-9abd2322fe81.png" alt="Inside (2016)"/>
</p>

[*Inside*](https://twitter.com/mcsaeid/status/1400948247670280194), on the other hand, was *unbelievably* good! Years later, I still catch myself thinking about it. It truly looks and feels like a game that George Orwell would have designed.

# 2015
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63400670/135320508-9244346e-63d8-4386-9717-f43dd83e5762.jpg" alt="2015"/>
</p>

2015 had new *Metal Gear Solid*, *Batman*, *Call of Duty*, *Halo*, *Rainbow Six*, *Fallout*, and so on. What more could a gamer want?

*Ori and the Blind Forest* is high on my wishlist.

# 2014
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63400670/135320516-7feecc2a-6200-4720-abfb-02679cd58a7a.jpg" alt="2014"/>
</p>

2014 was all right. I do remember playing a bit of *Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes* on PlayStation 3.

# 2013
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63400670/135320530-6285b26c-38e4-4980-8124-00756ec22a53.jpg" alt="2013"/>
</p>

Now 2013, I remember vividly. I *loved* it! I am a huge *Splinter Cell* fan, so it was very exciting to step back into Sam Fisher’s shoes with *Blacklist*, especially since it featured a mission in Tehran, Iran. Sadly, Michael Ironside wasn’t available to do Sam’s original voice.

### *Grand Theft Auto V*
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63400670/135467205-f7ad439e-5042-4911-8885-b1fc51e635ab.png" alt="Grand Theft Auto V (2013)"/>
</p>

[*Grand Theft Auto V*](https://twitter.com/mcsaeid/status/1323686385627353091) on PlayStation 3 was great too, but at the time, I was still drawn to *IV*. It was only in July of 2020 when I did a second playthrough that I completely fell in love with it. Now every time I want to relax, I hop into my favorite SUV, drive around, and listen to the radio.

*Beyond: Two Souls* was another memorable experience with great performances from Elliot Page and Willem Dafoe and an incredibly touching narrative, just as you would expect from the creators of *Heavy Rain* and *Indigo Prophecy* (known outside of the US as *Fahrenheit*).

# 2012
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63400670/135320537-ca90539a-12d1-4d1b-b588-8d866c2ab4c5.jpg" alt="2012"/>
</p>

When I think of 2012, I think of *Mass Effect 3* and how good it was, and I think of *Max Payne 3* and how I wished Remedy had made it. *Journey* looked gorgeous, and *Far Cry 3* was a far cry from my expectations of the series.

# 2011
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63400670/135320551-9cf1954a-b200-4222-bf5f-42502b6c0ef3.jpg" alt="2011"/>
</p>

What an amazing year 2011 was. Can you believe it’s been over ten years?

It was the year *Deus Ex: Human Revolution* introduced me to role-playing games (RPG). It was the perfect marriage of narrative and gameplay, and I was completely hooked. I still sometimes listen to the [original soundtrack](https://open.spotify.com/album/3t0h9Jw2lbQFCrBuDUMARd) by Michael McCann.

I still reminisce about *Skyrim* and how wonderful it felt to be immersed in a world of fantasy. Bethesda did a magnificent job at that. Since I’ve played both *Skyrim* and *Oblivion* but never *Morrowind*, I think it is best if I try that for a change. And we had *Portal 2* by Valve, which is still highly regarded.

*Uncharted 3* and *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3*, as well as *Batman: Arkham City*, were all masterfully done as well. The further back we go, we see more and more masterpieces, and more frequently.

# 2010
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63400670/135320827-43d28e5f-e5d5-43d0-8973-d8a781e40317.jpg" alt="2010"/>
</p>

2010 had a great lineup, NGL: *Mafia II*, *Mass Effect 2*, *Red Dead Redemption*, *Splinter Cell: Conviction*, *Alan Wake*, *Limbo*, *Heavy Rain*. What is there not to love? This was also the year I got my first summer job at my favorite video game store. It was a dream come true, to wake up every morning and go to work recommending or selling video games to other passionate souls, mostly teens my age. I distinctly remember the day *Mafia II* came out and how there was an influx of customers coming to the store to buy it—how fun and exciting that was. I went home that afternoon with my own copy. It’s one of my most treasured memories from my time there.

### *Limbo*
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff4435e6-59f7-40ed-9671-098b3e1e6e2b" alt="Limbo (2010)"/>
</p>

Playdead’s *Limbo* in particular deeply captured my imagination, and it’s been living in my subconscious ever since. In fact, when I revisited that game after thirteen years, I was consistently reminded of how deep my emotions ran. If you haven’t experienced this wonderful indie gem, do yourself a favor and pick it up. It is worth the ten dollars and then some! And it goes on sale quite regularly on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/48000/LIMBO).

### *Heavy Rain*
> How far will you go to save someone you love?

*Heavy Rain* really was more than just a video game for me. A decade later, I can still recall some of its most intense moments. They are so deeply entrenched in my mind that I can see them as if I have lived them. It changed me forever.

# 2009
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63400670/135320839-b7b7c999-6648-4911-86ef-3480c8ab4590.jpg" alt="2009"/>
</p>

2009 also ranks high in my book in that we saw fantastic sequels to *Assassin’s Creed*, *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare*, and *Uncharted*. Unfortunately, I couldn’t finish *Batman: Arkham Asylum* at the time due to a game-breaking bug, but I enjoyed it very much, along with both *F.E.A.R. 2* and *Resident Evil 5*. I did get a chance to play *Arkham Asylum* to completion in 2020 during COVID, and I’m happy to report that it still holds up today. It is without a doubt among the greatest *Batman* games ever created. If you’re looking for a purely fun, well-written superhero game with a memorable soundtrack and iconic performances, this is it.

# 2008
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63400670/135320851-88c1a222-ab42-4c02-b85f-1e246c5773d6.jpg" alt="2008"/>
</p>

Boy, did 2008 have some aces up its sleeve! *Grand Theft Auto IV* *and* *Metal Gear Solid 4*? You can’t top that.

**Fun fact:** I bought my PlayStation 3 in 2010 solely for two reasons: *Heavy Rain* and *Metal Gear Solid 4*.

# 2007
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63400670/135320863-a90d12df-5cf4-461d-aff7-54d425232b1f.jpg" alt="2007"/>
</p>

I think we can all agree that 2007 was one of the most fruitful years of the gaming industry. Ryan McCaffrey of IGN said it best on the [500th episode of *Unlocked*](http://youtu.be/WG84Sxjdy1Q?t=104): “*Halo 3*, *Crackdown*, *BioShock*, *Mass Effect*, *Rock Band*, *Project Gotham Racing 4*, *Eternal Sonata*, *Call of Duty 4*, the first *Assassin’s Creed*, *Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2*, *The Orange Box*, you could throw *The Darkness* in there, that was just such a monster year, it just seemed like it never ended.”

# 2006
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63400670/135320871-c1c92e7f-0f91-4763-80f1-892d7b86e7e2.jpg" alt="2006"/>
</p>

I am running out of adjectives to describe these . . . [looks in the dictionary] *glorious* years of the past. I will always remember 2006 with *Splinter Cell: Double Agent*, *25 to Life*, *Call of Duty 2*, and *The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion*.

# 2005
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63400670/135320896-2cca94a2-a08f-436a-95b6-1ef8b91d0892.jpg" alt="2005"/>
</p>

Ah, man. 2005 was so good! It was the year I bought [my very first computer](https://github.com/mcsaeid/Nostalgic-Video-Games#%D8%A7%D9%88%D9%84%DB%8C%D9%86-%DA%A9%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%BE%DB%8C%D9%88%D8%AA%D8%B1-1). Surely, it doesn’t get better than this.

. . . Or *does it*?

# 2004
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63400670/135320911-0481d4e3-4d45-48b3-a6c1-ec11d6893f97.jpg" alt="2004"/>
</p>

It *can* and *does* get better! 2004 was the year we got *Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas*, *Prince of Persia: Warrior Within*, *Half-Life 2*, and *Need for Speed: Underground 2*!

I honestly can’t pick one. They are *all* my favorites, especially the lesser-known *Second Sight*, with its paranormal abilities and stealth mechanics. To quote Tom Bramwell of Eurogamer who reviewed the game’s PC port in 2005, “*Second Sight* was very nearly love at first sight.”

And as for [*Counter-Strike*](https://fragfriend.com/category/counter-strike), who would’ve thought it would still be highly popular twenty years on?

# 2003
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63400670/135320918-9568721f-f449-4a0b-a3f4-65ab68ca473a.jpg" alt="2003"/>
</p>

2003 was a beast of a year. *Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time*, *Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne*, *Command & Conquer: Generals*, and *Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne*? Take me back, please!

# 2002
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63400670/135320923-ccb2f4f6-6476-4e3a-961d-c389f37b5d22.jpg" alt="2002"/>
</p>

‌2002. To this day, I still think back on the first time I saw *Grand Theft Auto: Vice City*, how it made me feel. I had never seen anything like it.

# 2001
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63400670/135320935-4f019da5-36eb-4b85-adb7-2d4f2ebd95d4.jpg" alt="2001"/>
</p>

2001, of course, holds a very special place in my heart because of *Max Payne* and *Grand Theft Auto III*. I wish I could tell you how or why. I guess no one will ever truly know how much these two—among many, many others—mean to me.
