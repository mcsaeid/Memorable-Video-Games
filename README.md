# üïπ Memorable Video Games: An Introduction
Video games, as a creative medium, have had a tremendous influence on me over the decades. As a means to celebrate, I want to take a look back at some of the most memorable titles of the past twenty years.

Each individual collage features twelve prominent games of the same year, followed by a short description. (This was initially published as a Twitter thread and later turned into a [Moment](https://twitter.com/i/events/1496211458907987972).) As a visual person and someone who appreciates image quality, probably the biggest challenge in creating this was finding high-quality cover art, especially for older titles. Some even had to be re-created. However, I do believe the things that challenge you the most also _teach_ you the most.

# 2021
<p align="center">

</p>

2021 was kind of hot!

Out of all the games above, I only played [_Twelve Minutes_](https://twitter.com/mcsaeid/status/1429035920351694851) in 2021. It is a fresh take on an old genre, and one that I got a kick out of. I very much look forward to catching up on all the other _Halo_ games so that I can finally dive into _Halo Infinite_.

# 2020
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63400670/135312941-f1cf5233-9608-49b2-8ecb-ad4a74597c23.jpg" alt="2020"/>
</p>

2020 gave me one of my favorites of all time, _Control_, and we celebrated its second birthday last month on August 27, 2021. With just the right amount of weird, phenomenal storytelling, and drop-dead gorgeous visuals, it deserves all the praise it gets.

Kudos to everyone at Remedy.

### _Control_
<p align="center">

</p>

Being a PC gamer, though, I feel like I am missing on so many amazing games: _The Last of Us_ series or _Ghost of Tsushima_ from this year alone. They are right up my alley. I very much need to get my hands on a recent PlayStation console.

I also played _Resident Evil 3_, which I enjoyed.

Read more about my experience with _Control_ [here](https://graph.org/Remedys-Control-A-Generation-Defining-Masterpiece-02-10).

# 2019
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63400670/135319254-74593d94-bbe8-41b8-a7e6-b7bf2cbdd799.jpg" alt="2019"/>
</p>

2019 was the year I got back into gaming after a seven-year break, reuniting with a long-lost passion that felt just as fulfilling as discovering it for the first time. So many greats came out that year, and I have yet to play most of them, but _Resident Evil 2_ and _A Plague Tale: Innocence_ are ones that stood out for me the most.

# 2018
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63400670/135319618-a96df816-a342-4666-ac73-2f4b3383bff6.jpg" alt="2018"/>
</p>

2018 gave us _Shadow of the Tomb Raider_, _Red Dead Redemption 2_ (even though I would play it two years later on PC), _God of War_, and a handful of remarkable indie games.

Looking back, I have fallen in love with the _Forza_ series, and I have been dying to get a racing wheel.

### _Red Dead Redemption 2_
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63400670/135465912-8a2c03fe-553c-46c0-9b17-bbb8d9ca0248.png" alt="Red Dead Redemption 2"/>
</p>

At the time of writing the original thread, I had only played a few hours of _Red Dead Redemption 2_, noting that it felt like quite an improvement over its predecessor. I still had it on my computer, and I was waiting for the right moment to jump back in. I finally did, [fourteen months later](https://twitter.com/mcsaeid/status/1283508320674942980), and it _blew_ my mind. I have since put in 100+ hours into the game, and I can see myself enjoying it for at least another fifty hours. I highly recommend reading ‚Äú[_Red Dead Redemption 2_ Is True Art](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/23/opinion/sunday/red-dead-redemption-2-fallout-76-video-games.html)‚Äù by The New York Times.

# 2017
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63400670/135319771-dbb45db2-726d-45b4-82c9-0af7173402d2.jpg" alt="2017"/>
</p>

2017 saw the likes of _The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild_ and _Horizon Zero Dawn_, with the former really tempting me to want to buy a Nintendo Switch.

It was an awesome year for indies as well, offering _Little Nightmares_, _Cuphead_, and _What Remains of Edith Finch_. _Sonic Mania_ gave me such a hard time, probably because I am not great at fast-paced platformers, but it was worth it in the end.

I started playing _Little Nightmares_ not long ago, and even though the controls can be clunky at times, it did feel special.

# 2016
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63400670/135319980-f053dc31-f98b-4fd4-84d7-1f069de04633.jpg" alt="2016"/>
</p>

2016 brought _Uncharted 4: A Thief‚Äôs End_, _Titanfall 2_, and _Quantum Break_, which, despite its shortcomings, I genuinely enjoyed.

### _Inside_
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63400670/135466338-4a2f201c-ae20-42c1-8696-9abd2322fe81.png" alt="Inside"/>
</p>

[_Inside_](https://twitter.com/mcsaeid/status/1400948247670280194), on the other hand, was unbelievably good. I still think about it. It truly looks and feels like a game that George Orwell would have designed.

# 2015
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63400670/135320508-9244346e-63d8-4386-9717-f43dd83e5762.jpg" alt="2015"/>
</p>

2015 had new _Metal Gear Solid_, _Batman_, _Call of Duty_, _Halo_, _Rainbow Six_, and _Fallout_, and so on. What more could a gamer want?

_Ori and the Blind Forest_ is high on my wishlist.

# 2014
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63400670/135320516-7feecc2a-6200-4720-abfb-02679cd58a7a.jpg" alt="2014"/>
</p>

2014 was all right. I do remember playing a bit of _Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes_ on PlayStation 3.

# 2013
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63400670/135320530-6285b26c-38e4-4980-8124-00756ec22a53.jpg" alt="2013"/>
</p>

Now 2013 I remember vividly. I _loved_ it. I am a huge _Splinter Cell_ fan, so it was very exciting to step back into Sam Fisher‚Äôs shoes with _Blacklist_, especially that it featured a mission in Tehran, Iran. Sadly, Michael Ironside wasn‚Äôt available to do Sam‚Äôs original voice.

### _Grand Theft Auto V_
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63400670/135467205-f7ad439e-5042-4911-8885-b1fc51e635ab.png" alt="Grand Theft Auto V"/>
</p>

[_Grand Theft Auto V_](https://twitter.com/mcsaeid/status/1323686385627353091) on PlayStation 3 was great too, but at the time, I was still drawn to _IV_. It was only in July of 2020 when I did a second playthrough that I completely fell in love with it. Now every time I want to relax, I hop into my favorite SUV, drive around, and listen to the radio.

_Beyond: Two Souls_ was another memorable experience with great performances from Elliot Page and Willem Dafoe and an incredibly touching narrative, just as you would expect from the creators of _Heavy Rain_ and _Indigo Prophecy_ (known outside of the US as _Fahrenheit_).

Unfortunately, I couldn‚Äôt get _The Last of Us_ to run on my then-jailbroken PlayStation 3.

# 2012
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63400670/135320537-ca90539a-12d1-4d1b-b588-8d866c2ab4c5.jpg" alt="2012"/>
</p>

When I think of 2012, I think of _Mass Effect 3_ and how good it was, and I think of _Max Payne 3_ and how I wished Remedy had made it. _Journey_ looked gorgeous, and _Far Cry 3_ was a far cry from my expectations of the series.

# 2011
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63400670/135320551-9cf1954a-b200-4222-bf5f-42502b6c0ef3.jpg" alt="2011"/>
</p>

What an amazing year 2011 was. Can you believe it has been ten years?

It was the year _Deus Ex: Human Revolution_ introduced me to role-playing games (RPG). It was the perfect marriage of narrative and gameplay, and I was just hooked. I still sometimes listen to its [original soundtrack by Michael McCann](https://soundcloud.com/michaelmccannmusic/sets/deus-ex-human-revolution-soundtrack).

I still reminisce about _Skyrim_ and how wonderful it felt to be immersed in a world of fantasy. Bethesda truly did a magnificent job. Since I have played both _Skyrim_ and _Oblivion_ but never _Morrowind_, I think it is best if I try that for a change. And we had _Portal 2_, by Valve, which is considered one of the best video games ever made.

_Uncharted 3_ and _Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3_, as well as _Batman: Arkham City_, were all masterfully done as well. The further back we go, we will see more and more masterpieces.

# 2010
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63400670/135320827-43d28e5f-e5d5-43d0-8973-d8a781e40317.jpg" alt="2010"/>
</p>

2010 had a great lineup, NGL: _Mafia II_, _Mass Effect 2_, _Red Dead Redemption_, _Splinter Cell: Conviction_, _Alan Wake_, _Limbo_, _Heavy Rain_. What is not to love? Playdead‚Äôs _Limbo_ in particular deeply captured my imagination, and it has been living in my subconscious ever since.

### _Heavy Rain_
> ‚ÄúHow far will you go to save someone you love?‚Äù

_Heavy Rain_ really was more than a video game for me. A decade later, I can still recall some of its most intense moments. They are so deeply entrenched in my mind that I can see them as if I have lived them. It changed me forever.

# 2009
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63400670/135320839-b7b7c999-6648-4911-86ef-3480c8ab4590.jpg" alt="2009"/>
</p>

2009 also ranks high in my book in that we saw awesome sequels to _Assassin‚Äôs Creed_, _Call of Duty: Modern Warfare_, and _Uncharted_. Unfortunately, I couldn‚Äôt finish _Batman: Arkham Asylum_ due to a game-breaking bug, but I still enjoyed it very much, along with both _F.E.A.R. 2_ and _Resident Evil 5_.

# 2008
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63400670/135320851-88c1a222-ab42-4c02-b85f-1e246c5773d6.jpg" alt="2008"/>
</p>

Boy, did 2008 have some aces up its sleeve! _Grand Theft Auto IV_ _and_ _Metal Gear Solid 4_? You can‚Äôt top that.

**Fun fact:** I bought my PlayStation 3 in 2010 solely for two reasons: _Heavy Rain_ and _Metal Gear Solid 4_.

# 2007
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63400670/135320863-a90d12df-5cf4-461d-aff7-54d425232b1f.jpg" alt="2007"/>
</p>

I think we can all agree that 2007 was one of the most fruitful years of the gaming industry. Ryan McCaffrey of IGN said it best on [the 500th episode of the Unlocked podcast](http://youtu.be/WG84Sxjdy1Q?t=104).

# 2006
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63400670/135320871-c1c92e7f-0f91-4763-80f1-892d7b86e7e2.jpg" alt="2006"/>
</p>

I am running out of adjectives to describe these . . . [looks up in dictionary] glorious years of the past.

I will always remember 2006 with _Splinter Cell: Double Agent_, _25 to Life_, _Call of Duty 2_, and _The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion_.

# 2005
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63400670/135320896-2cca94a2-a08f-436a-95b6-1ef8b91d0892.jpg" alt="2005"/>
</p>

Oh, man. 2005 was so good. It was the year I bought [my very first computer](https://github.com/mcsaeid/Nostalgic-Video-Games#%D8%A7%D9%88%D9%84%DB%8C%D9%86-%DA%A9%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%BE%DB%8C%D9%88%D8%AA%D8%B1-1). Surely, it doesn‚Äôt get better than this.

. . . Or _does it_?

# 2004
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63400670/135320911-0481d4e3-4d45-48b3-a6c1-ec11d6893f97.jpg" alt="2004"/>
</p>

It _can_ and _does_ get better. 2004 was the year we got _Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas_, _Prince of Persia: Warrior Within_, _Half-Life 2_, and _Need for Speed: Underground 2_.

I honestly can‚Äôt pick one. They are _all_ my favorites, especially the lesser-known Second Sight.

# 2003
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63400670/135320918-9568721f-f449-4a0b-a3f4-65ab68ca473a.jpg" alt="2003"/>
</p>

2003 was a beast of a year. _Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time_, _Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne_, _Command & Conquer: Generals_, and _Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne_? Take me back, please!

# 2002
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63400670/135320923-ccb2f4f6-6476-4e3a-961d-c389f37b5d22.jpg" alt="2002"/>
</p>

‚Äå2002. To this day, I still think back on the first time I saw _Grand Theft Auto: Vice City_, how it made me feel. I had never seen anything like it.

# 2001
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63400670/135320935-4f019da5-36eb-4b85-adb7-2d4f2ebd95d4.jpg" alt="2001"/>
</p>

2001, of course, holds a very special place in my heart because of _Max Payne_ and _Grand Theft Auto III_. I wish I could tell you how or why. I guess no one will ever truly know how much these two‚Äîamong many, many other video games‚Äîmean to me.

# 2000
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63400670/135320962-c380fa5d-486e-43eb-a44b-630335852124.jpg" alt="2000"/>
</p>

‚Äå2000. This is the last stop‚Äîfor now.

Thank you for taking a trip down memory lane with me. Do let me know your favorites.
